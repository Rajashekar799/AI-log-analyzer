# AI Log Analyzer TODO

## Completed
- [x] Create project directory: `ai-log-analyzer`
- [x] Set up `requirements.txt` with dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, python-multipart
- [x] Implement `log_collector.py`: Module for aggregating logs from sources (e.g., files, APIs), normalizing formats, and preprocessing (tokenization, feature extraction)
- [x] Implement `ml_engine.py`: ML model for classifying log patterns and detecting anomalies (e.g., using TF-IDF for text features and Isolation Forest for anomaly detection)
- [x] Implement `root_cause_suggester.py`: Module to analyze ML outputs and historical data to suggest root causes (e.g., rule-based or simple ML mapping)
- [x] Implement `app.py`: FastAPI application with endpoints for uploading logs, triggering analysis, and retrieving results
- [x] Create `static/index.html`: Simple web dashboard to upload logs, display analysis results, and show suggested root causes
- [x] Add sample data or mock logs for testing
- [x] Fix dashboard access issue by using absolute path resolution
- [x] Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [x] Run the FastAPI server with `python ai-log-analyzer/app.py`
- [x] Test the system with sample logs via API endpoints
- [x] Fix ML engine clustering issue for small datasets

## Remaining Tasks
- [x] Create README.md with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Optionally, integrate with real log sources (e.g., ELK stack) in future iterations
